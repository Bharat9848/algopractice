MST for a graph can be determined using Prim algorithm and Kruskal algorithm.Both are greedy algorithm. 
1. Prim algorithm similar to Djikstra algortithm for shortest path between two nodes chooses a new node every time based on minimum cost. Prim algorithm treats all the nodes in a intree as a single node and considers the non tree node with minimum distance from any of intree node. While the Djikstra algorithm chooses to minimumize distance to any non tree node from the original src node.
2. Kruskal algorithm uses union find data structure which articulates disjoint set data structure and help in optimizing union function which allows two disjoint set to collapse in single disjoint set and find operation which allows us to distinguish two nodes their respective disjoint sets. Each node starts with their own disjoint set. Then edges are sorted in order of their cost. Then at each step two distinct disjoint set of each edge's two node   collapse into one single disjoint set.
