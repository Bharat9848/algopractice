1.Given two strings  and  of equal length, what's the longest string () that can be constructed such that it is a child of both?
A string x is said to be a child of a string y if  can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from y.For
example, ABCD and ABDC has two children with maximum length 3, ABC and ABD. Note that we will not consider ABCD as a
common child because C doesn't occur before D in the second string.
