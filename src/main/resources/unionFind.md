## Union find 
1. Property-based grouping: The problem requires arranging elements with a certain property into groups or, to use graph terminology, into connected components. 
2. Set combination: We have been given a problem that contains elements represented as separate sets initially where we have to combine pairs of sets or find whether two elements belong to the same set or not. 
3. Graph data organization: The problem data is best organized in the form of a graph, yet the data has not been provided in the form of an adjacency list/matrix.

## Question
- Find connected graph is more efficient using union-find than through using BFS/DFS approach.
