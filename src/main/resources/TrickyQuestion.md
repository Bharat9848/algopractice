- P1041 -> Not able to figure out the terminating condition. Solution was to think problem in reverse condition.

- P380: problems to meet constraint for multiple criteria. It is easy to meet criteria for one constraint then you think how to meet other criteria by tweaking or adding some additional sol. If this strategy does not work then try thinking simple solution for second criteria and then try think about tweaking to meet first criteria. so on and on. **Do Not fixate on only one criterion**
