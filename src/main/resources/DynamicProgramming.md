Think of solution in terms of sub solution. 

Following are the ideas where DP are applicable
1. The problem can be broken down into "overlapping subproblems" - smaller versions of the original problem that are re-used multiple times.

2.The problem has an "optimal substructure" - an optimal solution can be formed from optimal solutions to the overlapping subproblems of the original problem.
