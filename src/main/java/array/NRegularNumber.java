 *
 * A regular number in mathematics is defined as one which evenly divides some power of 60. Equivalently, we can say that a regular number is one whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.
 *
 * These numbers have had many applications, from helping ancient Babylonians keep time to tuning instruments according to the diatonic scale.
 *
 * Given an integer N, write a program that returns, in order, the first N regular numbers.
 *
 * Try to draw pattern : 30 30*2 30*3 30*(2*2) 30*(5) 30*(2*3) 30*(2*2*2)
 * looks like problem is reduced to give some numbers. return their multiple in order
 * {2} {2,3} {2,3,4} {2,3,4,5} {2,3,4,5,6} {2,3,4,5,6,8} {2,3,4,5,6,8}
