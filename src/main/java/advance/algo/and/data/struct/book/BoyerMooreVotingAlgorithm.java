 *     There can be at most one majority element which is more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
 *     There can be at most two majority elements which are more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
 *     There can be at most three majority elements which are more than ⌊n/4⌋ times.
 * Algo implementation : if we strike out majority element with non majority element we will still have one majarity element left after processing all the variable.
