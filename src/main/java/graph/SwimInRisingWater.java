/**
 * todo
 * Given an n×nn×n grid (2D matrix) where each cell grid[i][j] represents the elevation at position (i, j).
 *
 * Once it starts to rain, the water level rises over time. At any given time t, the water depth across the grid equals t. A swimmer can move from one cell to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right) if both cells have elevations less than or equal to the current water level t.
 *
 * If the elevation condition is satisfied, a swimmer can swim any distance instantly. However, he cannot move outside the grid boundaries.
 *
 * Return the minimum time t at which it becomes possible to swim from the top-left cell (0,0)(0,0) to the bottom-right cell (n−1,n−1)(n−1,n−1).
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     n==n== grid.length
 *
 *     n==n== grid[i].length
 *
 *     1≤1≤ nn ≤30≤30
 *
 *     0≤0≤ grid[i][j] < n2< n2
 *
 *     Each value grid[i][j] is unique.
